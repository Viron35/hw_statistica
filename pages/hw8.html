            <h2>Analogies Between HW4 and HW7</h2>
            <p>
                Let discuss the deep analogies between the <strong>Law of Large Numbers
                (HW4)</strong> and the <strong>Attacker Random Walk (HW7)</strong>. Both simulations are, at 
                their core, visualizations of the same fundamental concept: the 
                <strong>Bernoulli Process</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3>Similarities and Differences</h3>
            <p>
                Both simulations involved running \(M\) independent trajectories, each 
                consisting of \(N\) steps (trials). The primary difference is not in 
                the process itself, but in <strong>what we measure</strong> 
                and <strong>what we plot</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the table shows, the Attacker Random Walk (HW7) is just a 
                <strong>specific case</strong> of the general Bernoulli process (HW4). 
                It is a "Simple Random Walk" because \(p=0.5\). The score \((+1, -1)\) is 
                just a different way of mapping the outcome than the frequency \((1, 0)\).

            <h2>Mathematical Properties and Relationships</h2>
            <p>
                The link between these processes and combinatorics is the 
                <strong>Binomial Distribution</strong>, which is the foundation for all 
                of them.
            </p>

            <h3>Binomial Coefficients & Pascal's Triangle</h3>
            <p>
                In HW7, we defined the final score after \(n\) steps as \(Score = 2S_n - n\), where 
                \(S_n\) is the total number of successes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The number of successes, \(S_n\), follows the Binomial Distribution. The 
                probability of getting exactly \(k\) successes in \(n\) trials is:
            </p>
            \[ P(S_n = k) = C(n, k) \cdot p^k \cdot (1-p)^{n-k} \]
            <p>
                The term \(C(n, k)\) (or \(\binom{n}{k}\)) is the <strong>binomial coefficient</strong>, 
                read "n choose k". It counts the number of different paths an attacker 
                could take to end up with exactly \(k\) successes.
            </p>
            <p>
                These coefficients are famously generated by <strong>Pascal's Triangle</strong>. Each 
                number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. 
                The \(n^{th}\) row of the triangle *is* the list of all possible values 
                for \(C(n, k)\) (from \(k=0\) to \(k=n\)).
            </p>
            

        <img src="../pascal.jpg" alt="Pascal" style="width:50%; max-width:600px;">


            <p>
                Therefore, the shape of our histogram in HW7 (and in HW4, if we set \(p=0.5\)) 
                is not just *like* the \(n^{th}\) row of Pascal's Triangle—it is a direct 
                visualization of it, scaled by the probability \(p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\).
            </p>

            <h3>Binomial Expansion</h3>
            <p>
                The coefficients are named after the <strong>Binomial Theorem</strong> (or Expansion), 
                which states:
            </p>
            \[ (x + y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} C(n, k) \cdot x^{n-k} \cdot y^k \]
            <p>
                The relationship becomes clear if we set \(x = (1-p)\) (probability of failure) 
                and \(y = p\) (probability of success):
            </p>
            \[ ((1-p) + p)^n = (1)^n = 1 \]
            \[ \sum_{k=0}^{n} C(n, k) \cdot (1-p)^{n-k} \cdot p^k = 1 \]
            <p>
                This shows that the <strong>Binomial Expansion</strong> is effectively the "generating function" 
                for the Binomial Distribution. Each term in the sum, \(C(n, k) \cdot p^k \cdot (1-p)^{n-k}\), 
                is precisely the probability of achieving \(k\) successes. The sum of all 
                possible outcomes (from 0 to n successes) must be 1.
            </p>

            <h3>The Fibonacci Sequence</h3>
            <p>
                A surprising and elegant connection exists between Pascal's Triangle and 
                the <strong>Fibonacci Sequence</strong> (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...).
            </p>
            <p>
                If you sum the "shallow diagonals" of Pascal's Triangle, the sums you 
                get are the Fibonacci numbers.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While less direct, this connects our Random Walk simulation to another 
                fundamental mathematical concept. The Fibonacci sequence appears in 
                combinatorial problems that involve counting paths with specific 
                constraints (e.g., "how many ways can you climb \(n\) stairs taking 
                steps of 1 or 2?"). This highlights the deep shared roots of all 
                path-counting problems, whether they are random walks (Binomial) or 
                constrained paths (Fibonacci).
