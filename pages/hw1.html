            <h3>What is Statistics?</h3>
            <p>
                Statistics is a branch of mathematics that involves the <strong>collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data</strong>. 
                It allows us to understand patterns, make predictions, and draw conclusions from a set of data, even when there is uncertainty. 
                Instead of looking at individual data points, statistics helps us see the "big picture" and identify underlying trends.

            <h3>Why can it be useful for Cybersecurity?</h3>
            <p>
                Cybersecurity generates massive amounts of data (logs, network traffic, user behavior). Statistics is essential for making sense of this data. Its uses include:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Anomaly Detection:</strong> Statistical models can learn what "normal" behavior looks like on a network (e.g., an employee logs in from 9 AM to 5 PM from the same location). When behavior strongly deviates from this norm (e.g., a login at 3 AM from a different country), the system can flag it as a potential security breach.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):</strong> Many IDS use statistical analysis to identify attack patterns. By analyzing network packet data, a system can statistically determine if traffic matches a known attack signature or if it's behaving in a way that suggests a new, unknown attack.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> Statistics is used to quantify risk. We can analyze historical data to determine the *probability* of a specific attack (e.g., a phishing email) and the *potential impact* (e.g., cost of a data breach). This helps companies decide where to best invest their security resources.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Spam and Phishing Filters:</strong> Your email filter is a great example of statistics in action. It uses statistical models (like Bayesian classifiers) to calculate the probability that an incoming email is "spam" or "phishing" based on the words it contains, the sender, and other factors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Malware Analysis:</strong> Analysts use statistics to find patterns in malicious code (malware). By comparing the code of a new virus to a database of known threats, they can identify shared characteristics and classify the new threat, which helps in developing an antivirus signature faster.

            </ul>
